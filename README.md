## Architecture

Wave Heart is built using the Flutter framework and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. The application is divided into three main layers:

- Model layer: This layer is responsible for defining the data model and managing the data layer. In Wave Heart, the model layer contains the data models for patients and reminders, as well as the database management code using the Sqflite package.
- View layer: This layer is responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions. The view layer in Wave Heart is implemented using the Flutter framework's widget tree and is responsible for displaying the UI components to the user.
- Controller layer: This layer is responsible for managing the business logic of the application and acts as the mediator between the view and model layers. The controller layer in Wave Heart contains the business logic for adding patients, creating reminders, and canceling or reactivating reminders.
